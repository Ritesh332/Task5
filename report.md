# Network Traffic Analysis Report

## Installation Guide

### Installing Wireshark on Windows:

1. Visit the official [Wireshark website](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).
2. Download the Windows installer.
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
4. During installation, install **WinPcap** or **Npcap** when prompted (used for packet capture).
5. Launch Wireshark after installation.

## Wireshark Interface Overview

 Shows all active network interfaces.

## Start Capture

 -  Select an interface and click the shark fin icon to begin capturing.

 - After capturing, click the red square on the toolbar to stop the capture.
 - Go to File > Save As (or press Ctrl + S).
 - Choose the destination folder and give your file a name, e.g., capture.pcapng.
 - Select the file format:
    .pcapng (default, recommended)
     or .pcap (older format, still compatible)
 - Click Save.

Here's my captured file:

## My Findings

 I used various techniques to analyze the packet and extract most of the information from it. Here's a breakdown:

 1. Protocol Hierarchy Observed

    ![Protocol Hierarchy](screenshots/protocol-hierarchy.png)

    Wiresharkâ€™s protocol hierarchy (visible via `Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy`) showed the following types:
    
    - **Ethernet II**
    - **IPv4**
    - **TCP**
    - **UDP**
    - **HTTP**
    - **DNS**
    - **Dropbox LAN Sync Protocol (DB-LSP)**
 
 2. Filtering captured packets by protocol

 3. Filtering captured packets by using multiple protocols

    ![Multiple Protocols Filtering](screenshots/mlti-protocol-filtering.png)

The captured network traffic in `capture.pcapng` is predominantly IPv4-based, with a high percentage of TCP traffic, a significant portion of which is encrypted using TLS. There's also a noticeable amount of UDP traffic, mainly consisting of DNS queries and responses, and some Dropbox LAN Sync discovery. The HTTP traffic observed is relatively small in proportion to the total traffic but provides clear examples of web requests and responses. The presence of both HTTP and TLS within the TCP traffic suggests a mix of unencrypted and encrypted web communication.
