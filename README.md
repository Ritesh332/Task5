# Task5 ‚Äì Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

##  Objective
Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark to identify different protocols and understand how devices communicate over a network.

## üõ† Tools Used
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) ‚Äì Network protocol analyzer

##  What I Did
- Installed Wireshark on my Windows machine.
- Started a live capture on the active network interface.
- Applied filters to view and isolate HTTP, DNS, and UDP packets.
- Exported the captured traffic into a `.pcapng` file.
- Took relevant screenshots of protocol-specific filtering.
- Documented my observations in a report.

##  Conclusion
This task helped me develop practical skills in network analysis and deepened understanding of how various protocols interact. Using
Wireshark provided valuable insights into packet-level internet communication.
